## JavaScript Microfrontends
rollcake-spa is a framework for bringing together multiple JavaScript micro frontends in a frontend application. Architecting your frontend using rollcake-spa enables many benefits, such as:

- Use multiple frameworks on the same page without page refreshing (React, AngularJS, Angular, Ember, or whatever you're using)
- Use a shared enviroment to consume data from a single source of truth and don't load the page until all micro frontends are ready and running at same time as a single product
- Deploy your microfrontends independently
- Write code using a new framework, without rewriting your existing app
